### What is this?

This is a clone of firefox. It aims to make browsing with firefox fast by integrating vim like keybindings to firefox.
The ultimate goal is to be able to fully control the browser with just the keyboard.

### why?

> Why don't you just use extensions like Vimium

There are numerous extensions that try to mimic vim like funcitonality in the browser.

The problem is that extensions are very limited. They can't trigger certain browser-level features
- No full history control
- Browser search
- Don't work in the browsers PDF viewer
- Don't work in the browsers settings
- Only work in an active website
- can't add browser level UI for example to show the current vim moe

because of that they have to either akwardly reimplement the feature with a javascript work around (like a custom search, or a custom url bar) or they just don't support the feature
To truly get a vim like experience you need browser level control.

> But there are already Browsers that try to do this

That's true but the options on the market don't fulfill the requirements that I need:

- I want the browser to be gecko engine based because Mozilla is non-profit and an advocate of the open web. There are enough chromium like browsers.
- the browser should support ARM architecure (Apple M1 to be specific) 
- the browser should look somewhat modern
- thr browser should support the widely available extensions
- the browser should support modern HTML, CSS, JS Features

This is why browsers like qutebrowsers don't qualify in my opinion
